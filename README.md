This is the code repository for [Mathematics for Game Programming and Computer Graphics](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mathematics-for-game-programming-and-computer-graphics/9781801077330), published by Packt.

**Explore the essential mathematics for creating, rendering, and manipulating 3D virtual environments**

## What is this book about?
Mathematics is an essential skill when it comes to graphics and game development, particularly if you want to understand the generation of real-time computer graphics and the manipulation of objects and environments in a detailed way. Python, together with Pygame and PyOpenGL, provides you the opportunity for to explore these features under the hood, revealing how computers generate and manipulate 3D environments.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Get up and running with Python, Pycharm, Pygame, and PyOpenGL
* Experiment with different graphics API drawing commands
* Review basic trigonometry and how it’s important in 3D environments
* Apply vectors and matrices to move, orient, and scale 3D objects
* Render 3D objects with textures, colors, shading, and lighting
* Work with vertex shaders for faster GPU-based rendering

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import pygame

pygame.init()
screen_width = 800
screen_height = 200
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, 
                 screen_height))

done = False
white = pygame.Color(255, 255, 255)

pygame.font.init()
font = pygame.font.SysFont('Comic Sans MS', 120, False, True)
text = font.render('Penny de Byl', False, white)
while not done:
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
      done = True
  screen.blit(text, (10, 10))
  pygame.display.update()
pygame.quit()

```
Throughout the book, the code assumes the external files (models, textures and shaders) are in the same folder as the code accessing them.  However, in GitHub, the external files are accessed as if one folder higher.  Please keep this in mind for referencing external files in the code.
For example, if your project files are organized like this:
```
Root folder
- Project 1
---  Main.py
---  Models
------  Teapot.obj
```
It means that the models folder containing the teapot model is in the same folder as the main.py code.  To reference Teapot.obj from inside Main.py the address is:
“Models/Teapot.obj”
However, if you would like to keep the external files in one place and outside any particular chapter project you can place them on the same level as each chapter code (as is referenced in GitHub).  This structure appears as:
```
Root folder
     Project 1
------  Main.py
---  Models
------  Teapot.obj
```
In this case, the address of Teapot.obj should be:
“../Models/Teapot.obj”

The “../” in the file address tells the code to look up one folder from where the code is running from.

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for programmers who want to enhance their 3D mathematics skills relating to computer graphics and computer games. Knowledge of high school–level mathematics and a working understanding in an object-orientated language is needed to grasp the contents present in this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-19).
